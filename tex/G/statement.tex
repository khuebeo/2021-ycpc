There is a grassland in front of Alice's house with some beautiful flowers.
Alice wants to fence up all of the flowers to be her garden.

The grassland is a 2D plane, and there are $m$ flowers on the grassland.
The $j$-th flower is on the integer position $(x_j,y_j)$.
There are also $n$  wood piles on the grassland.
The $i$-th flower is on the integer position $(x_i,y_i)$;
She wants her gardan is a **convex polygon**, 
that means if she wants to move from one place to another place in her garden, 
she can go in a straight line without going out of her garden.
The garden should have a positive area and all of the vertex should be a  wood pile on the grassland.
All of the flowers should be **strictly** inside the garden, 
that means the flower can not be outside the garden or on the border of the garden.
She needs some fences to fence up her garden so she wants to minimize the total length of the fences.
If she wants to put the fences between the $a$th  wood pile and the $b$the  wood pile, she needs $\sqrt{(x_a-x_b)^2+(y_a-y_b)^2}$ length of fences.

She is curious if she wants to use the $i$-th  wood piles as one of the vertices in her garden.
What is the minimal length of fences she needs? Can you help her?
